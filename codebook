variable - 79
The mean calculated from the mean and standard deviation measurements from the the features selected for the original database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. Variable with mean in it (i.e., tBodyAcc.mean...X) reference mean measurements and variable with std reference standard deviation measurements. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern. '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. The set of variables we evaluated that were estimated from these signals are: mean: Mean value and std: Standard deviation. Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
